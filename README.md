# Pipelined-MIPS-Processor

This project is a five stage pipelined MIPS processor with mitigation strategies to solve data and control hazards. It has been implemented and simulated on Vivado HLS 2020.2 and coded entirely in Verilog.

# Report
A MIPS pipelined processor faces several data hazards and control hazards. A detailed report of the strategies used to mitigate each of the data and control hazards is also added.
